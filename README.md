# Energy Production Prediction

## Description
Developed in 2023, "Energy Production Prediction" is a university project made during the third course of Computer Engineering at UC3M in collaboration with @angelmrtn.

It was made for the subject "Machine Learning" and corresponds to one of the practices of this course. The main goal of the project is to lean how to use different Machine Learning techniques like **Linear Regression**, **Kneighbours**, **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** to make predictions in regression problems. It also serves as a way to practice with data analysis and pre-processing.

**NOTE:** The code and explanations in the notebook are in spanish.

## Installation
The command to install all the necessary libraries is already included at the top of the notebook.

## Usage
The notebook is already executed but can be modified to experiment with the different sections.

## Problem Proposed
This jupyter notebooks includes the process of creating a model that predicts energy production by a set of wind turbines during 5 hours of the day. To do so, it uses techniques of **machine learning** to process the different attributes and their relations.

In this case, the file "procedimiento.ipynb" shows the process of experimentation and creating the model using part of the data while the file "modelo_final.ipynb" generates predictions for the other part. These are stored in a CSV file once they are finished.
